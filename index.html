            current undergraduate freshman at Carnegie Mellon University studying 
            Information Systems, hoping to double major in Artificial Intelligence 
            and minor in Human Computer Interactions. I was born in Beijing, China, 
            but grew up in Cupertino, California. Being in the heart of Silicon Valley, 
            I am passionate and curious about the power of technology to shape human lives 
            and the future. </p>

            I am passionate and curious about the power of technology to shape human lives 
            and the future. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing volleyball, getting boba, 
            playing cards with my friends, and watching mystery-solving shows. I am an extroverted 
            person that loves to meet new people and take on challenges, such as participating in 
            hackathons and innovating solutions in research. In the future, I hope to explore the 
            intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, such as using large language 
            models to protect digital privacy and defend against cyber threats. Feel free to reach out 
            because I would love to connect and explore new opportunities with like-minded individuals.
